Explanations.

Shaders:

Water Waves
    - I believe that the waves of the water being dynamic within the scene has a heavy impact on the scene itself as it adds some more movement, and (Assuminig you can't see past the horizon) it has a nice bumpy effect that imitates real life waves which could add to the immersion if done right

Alpha Blending
    - I added this instead of real models as the camera would never actually go into the background and accidentally reveal the "2D" nature of these trees. There was an issue with the transparency that made them come out translucent, but you agreed that it could be an issue with the code.

Bump Mapping
    - I added this to add some realism to the grass, however I don't believe that it added the level of detail that I was expecting it to. This one I can say probably wasn't an improvement but was a downgrade to the scene.

Rim Lighting
    - I added some rim lighting to the character to indicate where in the world they could be relative to the camera and add some extra reflection to the character. I think this is a valid improvement as it does add some real lighting elements with the slight glow of the character, however, to make it better I would have changed the color and maybe made it more subtle.
